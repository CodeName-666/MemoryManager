# MemoryManager

The `MemoryManager` class provides an interface to store and manage data using a specified storage interface. It allows you to add and remove storage entries, read and write data to the storage interface, and perform various memory management operations.

## Usage

To use the `MemoryManager` class in your project, follow these steps:

1. Include the `MemoryManager.h` header file in your source file:

```cpp
#include "MemoryManager.h"
```

2. Create an instance of the `MemoryManager` class:

```cpp
MemoryManager memoryManager;
```

3. Configure the storage interface and memory settings by adding configurations and interfaces using the provided methods:

```cpp
MemoryManagerConfig_t config;
// Set the configuration values
memoryManager.add_config(config);

Memory memoryInterface;
// Initialize the memory interface
memoryManager.add_interface(memoryInterface);
```

4. Initialize the storage interface:

```cpp
memoryManager.begin();
```

5. Use the available methods to perform memory management operations, such as adding and removing storage entries, reading and writing data, and verifying memory integrity.

```cpp
// Add a new storage entry
MemoryManagerBlock newMemoryBlock;
uint16_t entryIndex = memoryManager.add_block(newMemoryBlock);

// Read data from a storage entry
memoryManager.read_entry(entryIndex);

// Write data to the storage interface
memoryManager.write_all();

// Remove a storage entry
memoryManager.remove_block(entryIndex);
```

6. When you're done using the `MemoryManager` instance, you can shut it down:

```cpp
memoryManager.shutdown();
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples that demonstrate the usage of the `MemoryManager` class:

1. Adding a Storage Entry:

```cpp
MemoryManager memoryManager;
MemoryManagerBlock newMemoryBlock;

// Set the necessary parameters of the new memory block

// Add the memory block to the storage
uint16_t entryIndex = memoryManager.add_block(newMemoryBlock);
```

2. Reading Data from a Storage Entry:

```cpp
MemoryManager memoryManager;
uint16_t entryIndex = 0; // Index of the storage entry to read

// Read the storage entry
memoryManager.read_entry(entryIndex);
```

3. Writing Data to the Storage Interface:

```cpp
MemoryManager memoryManager;

// Write all storage entries to the storage interface
memoryManager.write_all();
```

4. Removing a Storage Entry:

```cpp
MemoryManager memoryManager;
uint16_t entryIndex = 0; // Index of the storage entry to remove

// Remove the storage entry
memoryManager.remove_block(entryIndex);
```

## Methods

Here are the available methods of the `MemoryManager` class:

- `MemoryManager()`: Default constructor for the `MemoryManager` class.
- `MemoryManager(Memory& interface, MemoryManagerConfig_t& config)`: Constructor for the `MemoryManager` class with parameters for the storage interface and configuration.
- `void add_config(MemoryManagerConfig_t& config)`: Adds a `MemoryManagerConfig_t` object to the storage configuration.
- `void add_interface(Memory& interface)`: Adds an `IStorage` object to the storage interface.
- `void begin()`: Initializes the storage interface.
- `void loop()`: Runs the main storage loop.
- `uint16_t add_block(MemoryManagerBlock& new_memory_block)`: Adds a new storage entry to the data list and returns its index.
- `void remove_block(MemoryManager

Block& memory_block)`: Removes a storage entry from the data list.
- `void remove_block(uint16_t entry_index)`: Removes a storage entry from the data list based on its index.
- `void read_entry(uint16_t entry_index)`: Reads data from a storage entry based on its index.
- `void write_entry(uint16_t entry_index)`: Writes data to a storage entry based on its index.
- `void write_all()`: Writes all storage entries to the storage interface.
- `void shutdown()`: Shuts down the `MemoryManager` instance.

## Data Types

The `MemoryManager` module defines several data types used in its implementation. Here are the descriptions of those data types:

- `MemoryDataCompare_e`: An enumeration representing the comparison result of memory data.
- `MemoryManagerStatus_e`: An enumeration representing the status of the `MemoryManager` instance.
- `MemoryManagerType_e`: An enumeration representing the type of memory data.
- `MemoryBlockWrite_e`: An enumeration representing the write behavior of a memory block.
- `MemoryBlockParams_t`: A structure holding the parameters of a memory block.
- `MemoryManagerBlock`: A class representing a block of memory managed by the `MemoryManager`.
- `MemoryManagerVersion_t`: A union representing the version of the `MemoryManager`.
- `MemoryManagerHeader_t`: A structure representing the header of the `MemoryManager`.
- `MemoryManagerConfig_t`: A structure representing the configuration of the `MemoryManager`.
